In order to run the Neural Network, you must run the following programs in order:

Side note: MAKE SURE YOU HAVE PYBRAIN INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER

1: passwordGenerator.py  (To generate all permutations of passwords because sending them in the file wouldn't work, even if it was zipped).
2: passwordConvertor.py (To convert all the passwords into their binary representations)
3: SecurityIRCMain.py 

With SecurityIRCMain.py, there will be a delay with user input because the Neural Network will train first on the data. Then you have the commands to use,
however, you must type in the commands as seen (although it changes your case to lower). When using the "test" command, type in "testDataConv" excluding the
quotation marks, because that is the data you will be using for testing. Entering in a file that doesn't exist will throw an error (so no testing that, I
didn't implement that).
